DESCRIPTION
------------



BUILD
------

go build syslog-redirector


INSTALLATION
-------------

aptitude install syslog-redirector

DEVELOPING
----------

Prerequisites:

* syslog listening to a port somewhere you can talk to

USING
-----
syslog-redirector -h syslog_host:port -n logname -- executable [args...]

Example:
./syslog-redirector -h 10.0.3.1:6514 -n test-ls-thingy -- ls -l

This would run the command
  ls -l
and redirect it's stdout and stderr to TCP syslog running at 
  10.0.3.1:6514
and the name that will show up in the syslogs is test-ls-thingy.

Standard out will be logged as LOG_INFO and standard error will be logged as LOG_ERROR.
